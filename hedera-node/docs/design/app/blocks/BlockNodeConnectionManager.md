## Abstract

This document describes the internal design and responsibilities of the `BlockNodeConnectionManager` class.
This component manages active connections, handling connection lifecycle, and coordinating
with individual connection instances. There should be only one active connection at a time.
The class also interacts with the `BlockStreamStateManager` to synchronize stream state.

## Definitions

<dl>
<dt>BlockNodeConnectionManager</dt>
<dd>The class responsible for managing and tracking all active block node connections, including creation, teardown, and error recovery.</dd>

<dt>BlockNodeConnection</dt>
<dd>A representation of a single connection to block node, managed by the connection manager.</dd>

<dt>BlockStreamStateManager</dt>
<dd>The component responsible for maintaining the state of block streams received or sent over connections.</dd>

<dt>Connection Lifecycle</dt>
<dd>The phases a connection undergoes.</dd>
</dl>

## Component Responsibilities

- Maintain a registry of active connection instances.
- Track the latest verified block for each connection.
- Select the most appropriate connection for streaming blocks.
- Retry failed connections with exponential backoff.
- Remove or replace failed connections.
- Support lifecycle control.

## Component Interaction

- Maintains a bidirectional association with each connection.
- Delegates block-related streaming control to the `BlockStreamStateManager`.
- Updates connection state and retry schedule based on feedback from connections.

## Sequence Diagrams

### Connection Establishment

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Manager as BlockNodeConnectionManager
    participant StreamMgr as BlockStreamStateManager
    participant Conn as BlockNodeConnection

    Manager->>Manager: selectBlockNodeForStreaming()
    Manager->>Conn: set as active
    Manager->>StreamMgr: setActiveConnection(Conn)
    StreamMgr-->>Manager: ready to stream
```

### Connection Error and Retry

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Conn as BlockNodeConnection
    participant Manager as BlockNodeConnectionManager

    Conn-->>Manager: onError(Throwable)
    Manager->>Conn: disconnect()
    Manager->>Manager: scheduleRetry(Conn, delay)
    Note over Manager: Retry with backoff delay
```

### Shutdown Lifecycle

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Manager as BlockNodeConnectionManager

    Manager->>Manager: shutdown()
    loop over all connections
        Manager->>Conn: disconnect()
    end
```

## Error Handling

- Implements backoff-based retry scheduling when connections fail.
- Detects and cleans up errored or stalled connections.
- If `getLastVerifiedBlock()` or other state is unavailable, logs warnings and may skip the connection.
- Ensures that only one active connection is driving the stream via coordination with `BlockStreamStateManager`.
