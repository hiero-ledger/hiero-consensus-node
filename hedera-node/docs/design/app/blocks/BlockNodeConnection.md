## Abstract

`BlockNodeConnection` represents a single connection between a consensus node and a block node.
It manages connection state, handles communication, and reports errors to the `BlockNodeConnectionManager`.

## Definitions

<dl>
<dt>BlockNodeConnection</dt>
<dd>A connection instance managing communication and state with a block node.</dd>

<dt>ConnectionState</dt>
<dd>Represents current connection status: UNINITIALIZED, PENDING, ACTIVE, CLOSING, CLOSED.</dd>
</dl>

## Component Responsibilities

- Establish and maintain the connection transport.
- Handle incoming and outgoing message flow.
- Detect unresponsive block nodes via configurable timeouts on pipeline operations.
- Report connection errors promptly.
- Coordinate with `BlockNodeConnectionManager` on lifecycle events.
- Notify the block buffer when a block has been acknowledged and therefore eligible to be pruned.

## Component Interaction

- Communicates bi-directionally with `BlockNodeConnectionManager`.

## Lifecycle

A block node connection gets spawned by the `BlockNodeConnectionManager`. There are multiple ways in which a connection
may get created, such as:
- Initial consensus node startup, which randomly selects a node with the highest priority
- Periodic connection reset
- Connection failure (e.g. `EndStream` response received) that causes the connection to restart

When the connection is created, it starts in the `UNINITIALIZED` state. This state signals that the connection object is
created, but the underlying gRPC connection between the consensus node and the block node is not yet established. When
the connection was created, optionally a specific block number to begin streaming with can be passed in. If one is not
specified, then the connection will pick a block based on the state of the block buffer.

The next transitional state is `PENDING`. When the underlying gRPC connection is established (by invoking
`#createRequestPipeline`) the state will transition to `PENDING` indicating that the connection was successfully created.
No traffic is occurring over the connection in this state, merely this state indicates that the connection is _ready_ to
start handling traffic.

Once the connection manager has established that a connection is to become the new active connection, the connection's
state will get updated to `ACTIVE`. This state signals that the connection is actively processing requests and responses
to and from the block node.

Once the state transitions to `ACTIVE`, a worker thread is spawned for the connection. This worker is responsible for
sending requests to the block node. The worker operates in a loop, sleeping for a short period of time - determined by
the configuration property `blockNode.connectionWorkerSleepDuration`. When not sleeping, the worker will first check if
the current streaming block needs to be updated. If this is the first time the worker has performed this check, one of
the following will happen:
- If the connection with initialized with an explicit block to start with, then that block will be loaded from the block buffer.
- If the connection wasn't initialized with an explicit block, then the earliest, unacknowledged block in the block buffer
will be selected as the starting point.
- If no blocks in the block buffer have been acknowledged, then the earliest block in the buffer will be selected.
- If at any point during the lifespan of the connection a `SkipBlock` or `ResendBlock` response is received, then the
worker will detect this and switch to that block.

If the block is not available yet (e.g. no items yet) then the worker will go back to sleep and try again later. If the
block does exist, then the worker thread will start collecting one or more block items to form a "pending" request that
will ultimately be sent to the block node. If there are multiple block items to send, but they are found - in aggregate -
that they are too large to send in one request, then multiple requests will be sent. In general, sending a request will
happen in one of three scenarios:
- The pending request cannot support more block items because it would be too large, so the current pending request will be sent.
- If the pending request contains the last item(s) - including the proof - and the block is marked as closed, send the request.
- If a request hasn't been sent recently (determined by the configuration property `blockNode.maxRequestDelay`) and there
is a pending request with at least one block item, it will get sent.

If none of these conditions are met, the worker will sleep and try again the next time it wakes up. If a block item is
found that would exceed the maximum request size (as measured in bytes) supported, then an error will be recorded and
the connection will be closed after sending an `EndStream` request to the block node, which the error code `ERROR`. Such
a scenario is considered a fatal, unrecoverable error condition. Manual intervention would be needed to recover from this
(for example: increasing the maximum size allowed, if possible.)

Under normal situations, the worker will continue advancing to the next block after it has successfully sent all items
associated with the current block. This process will repeat until the connection is terminated for any reason. (A
conditional check is performed each time the worker wakes up ensuring the connection is not in a terminal state.)

For cases where an `EndStream` response is received from the block node or some other internal error condition is encountered
\- e.g. transient network error - then the connection will transition to a `CLOSING` state. This state signals that the connection
has entered a terminal state and is in the process of stopping and being cleaned up. Once final cleanup processes complete,
the connection will transition to the final end state: `CLOSED`. Once a connection enters a terminal state, no further
actions - such as sending requests - should be performed on the connection. Likewise, once the connection worker detects
the transition to a terminal state, it too will cease operations.

To establish a connection back to the block node, a new connection object will need to be created.

### Connection States

- **UNINITIALIZED**: Initial state when a connection object is created. The bidi RequestObserver needs to be created.
- **PENDING**: The bidi RequestObserver is established, but this connection has not been chosen as the active one (priority-based selection).
- **ACTIVE**: Connection is active and the Block Stream Worker Thread is sending `PublishStreamRequest`s to the block node through the async bidirectional stream. Only one connection can be ACTIVE at a time.
- **CLOSING**: The connection is being closed. This is a terminal state where only cleanup operations are permitted. No more requests can be sent.
- **CLOSED**: Connection has been fully closed and the pipeline terminated. This is a terminal state. No more requests can be sent and no more responses will be received.

**Notes:**
- **Exponential Backoff**: When enabled, delay starts at 1 second and doubles (2x multiplier) on each retry attempt with jitter applied (delay/2 + random(0, delay/2)) to spread out retry attempts. Max backoff is configurable via `maxBackoffDelay`.
- **Connect to Other Node**: When "Yes (immediate)", the manager will immediately attempt to connect to the next available priority node while the failed node is rescheduled for retry.
- **Restart at Block**: "Latest" means reconnection starts at the latest produced block; "blockNumber + 1" means reconnection continues from the block following the acknowledged block.

</dl>

### Pipeline Operation Timeout

To detect unresponsive block nodes during message transmission and connection establishment, the connection implements configurable timeouts for pipeline operations.

#### Timeout Behavior

Pipeline operations (`onNext()`, `onComplete()`, and pipeline creation) are potentially blocking I/O operations that are executed on a dedicated virtual thread executor with timeout enforcement using `Future.get(timeout)`. Each connection instance creates its own virtual thread executor to isolate pipeline operations from other tasks and prevent blocking.

- **Pipeline creation timeout**: When establishing the gRPC connection via `createRequestPipeline()`, both the gRPC client creation and bidirectional stream setup are executed with timeout protection. If the operation does not complete within the configured timeout period:
  - The Future is cancelled to interrupt the blocked operation
  - The timeout metric is incremented
  - A `RuntimeException` is thrown with the underlying `TimeoutException`
  - The connection remains in UNINITIALIZED state
  - The connection manager's error handling will schedule a retry with exponential backoff
- **onNext() timeout**: When sending block items via `sendRequest()`, the operation is submitted to the connection's dedicated executor and the calling thread blocks waiting for completion with a timeout. If the operation does not complete within the configured timeout period:
  - The Future is cancelled to interrupt the blocked operation
  - The timeout metric is incremented
  - `handleStreamFailure()` is triggered (only if connection is still ACTIVE)
  - The connection follows standard failure handling with exponential backoff retry
  - The connection manager will select a different block node for the next attempt if one is available
  - `TimeoutException` is caught and handled internally
- **onComplete() timeout**: When closing the stream via `closePipeline()`, the operation is submitted to the same dedicated executor with the same timeout mechanism. If the operation does not complete within the configured timeout period:
  - The Future is cancelled to interrupt the blocked operation
  - The timeout metric is incremented
  - Since the connection is already in CLOSING state, only the timeout is logged
  - The connection completes the close operation normally

**Note**: The dedicated virtual thread executor is properly shut down when the connection closes with a 5-second grace period for termination, ensuring no resource leaks. If tasks don't complete within the grace period, `shutdownNow()` is called to forcefully terminate them.

#### Exception Handling

The implementation handles multiple exception scenarios across all timeout-protected operations:
- **TimeoutException**: Pipeline operation exceeded the timeout - triggers failure handling for `onNext()` and pipeline creation, logged for `onComplete()`
- **InterruptedException**: Thread was interrupted while waiting - interrupt status is restored via `Thread.currentThread().interrupt()` before propagating the exception (for `onNext()` and pipeline creation) or logging it (for `onComplete()` and executor shutdown)
- **ExecutionException**: Error occurred during pipeline operation execution - the underlying cause is unwrapped and re-thrown (for `onNext()` and pipeline creation) or logged (for `onComplete()`)

All exception scenarios include appropriate DEBUG-level logging with context information to aid in troubleshooting.

#### Metrics

A new metric `conn_pipelineOperationTimeout` tracks the total number of timeout events for pipeline creation, `onNext()`, and `onComplete()` operations, enabling operators to monitor block node responsiveness and connection establishment issues.
