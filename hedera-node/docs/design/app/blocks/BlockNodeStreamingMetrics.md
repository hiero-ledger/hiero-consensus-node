# Metrics for Block Node Streaming

The consensus node emits several metrics related to interactions with the block nodes. All metrics use the "blockStream"
category. These metrics use the standard metrics implementation used by the consensus node application and no additional
configuration is required to access them.

## Buffer Metrics

These metrics relate to the block buffer and are identified by the prefix "buffer".

|              Metric Name               |      Type      |                                     Description                                     |
|----------------------------------------|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `blockStream_buffer_saturation`        | Gauge (double) | Latest saturation of the block buffer as a percent (0.0 to 100.0)                   |
| `blockStream_buffer_latestBlockOpened` | Gauge (long)   | The block number that was most recently opened                                      |

| `blockStream_buffer_numBlocksClosed`   | Counter        | Number of blocks closed in the block buffer                                         |
| `blockStream_buffer_numBlocksMissing`  | Counter        | Number of attempts to retrieve a block from the block buffer but it was missing     |
| `blockStream_buffer_backPressureState` | Gauge (long)   | Current state of back pressure (0=disabled, 1=action-stage, 2=recovering, 3=active) |

## Connectivity Metrics

These metrics relate to general connectivity events between the consensus node and the block node. They are prefixed
with "conn" for identification.

| `blockStream_conn_opened`        | Counter | Number of block node connections opened                                            |
| `blockStream_conn_closed`        | Counter | Number of block node connections closed                                            |
| `blockStream_conn_noActive`      | Counter | Number of times streaming a block was attempted but there was no active connection |
| `blockStream_conn_createFailure` | Counter | Number of times establishing a block node connection failed                        |

## Connection Receive Metrics

These metrics relate to responses received from a block node. They are identified using the "connRecv" prefix.

|                    Metric Name                     |  Type   |                       Description                        |

## Connection Send Metrics

These metrics relate to the requests sent from the consensus node to a block node. They are identified using the
"connSend" prefix.
