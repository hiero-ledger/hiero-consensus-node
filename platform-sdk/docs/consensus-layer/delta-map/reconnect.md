# Delta map: reconnect

## Summary

The proposal removes reconnect from Consensus entirely: Execution learns of a
fallen-behind node via `onBehind`, obtains a state, and destroys and recreates
the Consensus instance. None of that ownership transfer has begun — reconnect
remains a consensus-internal procedure, and detection is consumed internally
rather than surfaced to Execution.

## Changes

| Change | Proposal state | Proposal source | Current state | Status | Anchor / TBD |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Execution owns reconnect; Consensus destroyed and recreated | Reconnect is an Execution procedure; the Consensus instance is torn down on falling behind and re-initialized afterwards. | [§ Lifecycle of the Consensus Module](../../proposals/consensus-layer/Consensus-Layer.md#lifecycle-of-the-consensus-module), [§ Falling Behind](../../proposals/consensus-layer/Consensus-Layer.md#falling-behind) | Reconnect remains implemented inside consensus-layer modules. | **not-started** | `ReconnectController`, `ReconnectCoordinator` (`consensus-reconnect-impl`) |
| `onBehind` public-API callback | Falling behind surfaces to Execution as a public callback; Execution decides the response. | [§ onBehind](../../proposals/consensus-layer/Consensus-Layer.md#onbehind), [§ Falling Behind](../../proposals/consensus-layer/Consensus-Layer.md#falling-behind) | Detection triggers the consensus-internal reconnect flow; no callback to Execution. | **not-started** | `FallenBehindMonitor` (`consensus-utility`) — consensus-internal consumption intact |
