# Design Proposal: Introducing a Low-Level State API and Refactoring the Existing State API

---

## Summary

This proposal outlines the introduction of a new low-level State API and the refactoring of the current State API. The primary goal is to establish a clean separation between the State API and application logic, facilitating seamless integration with the Block Node.

## Purpose and Context

The current State API has several critical design flaws:

* It depends on the HAPI module, which impedes integration with the Block Node due to differences in protobuf protocol definitions.
* It includes interfaces and logic that are tightly coupled to the application layer but do not belong in the state management layer.

Previously, before the [typeless Virtual Map](https://github.com/hiero-ledger/hiero-consensus-node/issues/16785) implementation, we had to rely on service schemas to obtain codecs for key and value types. With that limitation removed, we now have the opportunity to introduce a clearer separation of concerns and eliminate unnecessary dependenciesâ€”such as the dependency on HAPI.

### Java classes

New `BinaryState` interface will be defined as follows:

```java
/**
 * Represents low-level State API to store singletons, key/value pairs, and queues by their ids.
 * Note that ids are defined by {@code VirtualMapKey} (see {@code virtual_map_state.proto}).
 * However, this module does not depend on the HAPI module directly, so the ids are just integers.
 * Service/state name to integer id mapping is defined in the {@code com.swirlds.state.BinaryStateUtils#stateIdFor} class.
 */

    /**
     * Puts serialized singleton value.
     *
     * @param id an id of the singleton type

## Migration Strategy

The goal of this refactoring is to provide a clean, low-level interface for interacting with state.
The implementation of this interface should have minimal dependencies and **must not** depend on the HAPI module.

The existing `State` interface, along with its related interfaces and implementations, will be moved to the `hedera-app` module,
to `com.hedera.node.app.state` package.

However, to make this migration possible, we need to refactor the code in `swirlds-platform-core` that depends on the `State` interface and the related classes.

This code includes but not limited to:
- PlatformStateService, PlatformStateFacade, ReadablePlatformStateStore / WritablePlatformStateStore
- ReadableRosterStore / WritableRosterStore
- V0540PlatformStateSchema
- V0540RosterBaseSchema

The general strategy is to replace the usage of the `State` interface with the new `BinaryState` interface, or, in case of schemas,
come up with an alternative way initialization the roster singleton or the platform state.

After this refactoring, the State implementation will still be responsible for maintaining state change listeners and the registry of readable and writable states.
However, the responsibility for snapshot creation and hash calculation will be delegated to `BinaryState`.

## Testing

This refactoring doesn't add any new functionality.  All existing Hedera unit tests should pass with
the new binary state implementation. `BinaryState` should be covered by a set of unit tests.

## Performance impact

This refactoring introduces a thin abstraction layer between `VirtualMap` and `State` implementation. It should not have any
significant impact on performance.
