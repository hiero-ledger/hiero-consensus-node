# Design Proposal: Introducing a Low-Level State API and Refactoring the Existing State API

---

## Summary

This proposal outlines the introduction of a new low-level State API and the refactoring of the current State API. The primary goal is to establish a clean separation between the State API and application logic, facilitating seamless integration with the Block Node.

## Purpose and Context

The current State API has several critical design flaws:

* It depends on the HAPI module, which impedes integration with the Block Node due to differences in protobuf protocol definitions.
* It includes interfaces and logic that are tightly coupled to the application layer but do not belong in the state management layer.

Previously, before the [typeless Virtual Map](https://github.com/hiero-ledger/hiero-consensus-node/issues/16785) implementation, we had to rely on service schemas to obtain codecs for key and value types. With that limitation removed, we now have the opportunity to introduce a clearer separation of concerns and eliminate unnecessary dependenciesâ€”such as the dependency on HAPI.

### Java classes

New `State` interface will be defined as follows:

```java
public interface BinaryState extends FastCopyable {

     *
     * @param id an id of the singleton type
     */

    /**
     * Gets serialized singleton value.
     *
     * @param id an id of the singleton type
     * @return The value, or null if there is no value.
    */
    Bytes getSingleton(int id);

    /**
     * Adds a new value to the store, or updates an existing value.
     * Puts a key/value pair represented as {@code Bytes} objects

}
```

## Migration Strategy

The goal of this refactoring is to provide a clean, low-level interface for interacting with state.
The implementation of this interface should have minimal dependencies and **must not** depend on the HAPI module.

The existing `State` interface, along with its related interfaces and implementations, should be moved to the `swirlds-platform-core` module. To reduce the changeset,
target package should be exactly the same - `com.swirlds.state`.

Ideally, these classes would be relocated to `hedera-app-api` and `hedera-app`, but that would result in a much larger refactor beyond the scope of this proposal.

For instance, `PlatformStateFacade` is currently used in 78 classes. Eliminating the dependency on `State` would require
migrating this class to use `BinaryState`, which would involve significant effort.

Instead, this proposal recommends that the current `State` implementation should be refactored to **delegate to** the new `BinaryState` interface.
This approach provides two key benefits:
- It limits the scope of changes required.
- It enables the Block Node to use the `swirlds-state-api` and `swirlds-state-impl` modules directly.

After this refactoring, the State implementation will still be responsible for maintaining state change listeners and the registry of readable and writable states.
However, the responsibility for snapshot creation and hash calculation will be delegated to `BinaryState`.

## Testing

This refactoring doesn't add any new functionality.  All existing Hedera unit tests should pass with
the new binary state implementation. `BinaryState` should be covered by a set of unit tests.

## Performance impact

This refactoring introduces a thin abstraction layer between `VirtualMap` and `State` implementation. It should not have any
significant impact on performance.
