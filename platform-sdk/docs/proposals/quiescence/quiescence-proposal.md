# Quiescence

---

## Summary

Quiescence is feature that stops event creation when there are no transactions. The purpose of this is to reduce the
amount of data produced by low volume networks.

## Purpose and Context

The purpose of this is to reduce the amount of data produced by low volume networks. When no there are no transactions
being submitted to the network, the network can stop creating events, and thus stop producing blocks. This can
drastically reduce the amount of data that needs to be stored long term.

### Requirements

- When transactions stop being submitted to the network, the network should stop producing events in a timely manner.
- The amount of time it takes the network to stop should be close to the C2C time of the network.
- Once a transaction is submitted to the network, the network should start producing events and reach consensus on this
  newly submitted transaction.
- No existing functionality should be affected.
- Metrics should not produce misleading information due to the pause in event creation.

## Quiescence mechanisms

The quiescence can be broken up into 2 separate problems:
- Detecting when to quiesce
- Breaking quiescence

## Changes

### Architecture and/or Components

Describe any new or modified components or architectural changes. This includes thread management changes, state
changes, disk I/O changes, platform wiring changes, etc. Include diagrams of architecture changes.

Remove this section if not applicable.

### Module Organization and Repositories

Describe any new or modified modules or repositories.

Remove this section if not applicable.

### Core Behaviors

Describe any new or modified behavior. What are the new or modified algorithms and protocols? Include any diagrams that
help explain the behavior.

Remove this section if not applicable.

### Public API

Describe any public API changes or additions. Include stakeholders of the API.

Examples of public API include:

* Anything defined in protobuf
* Any functional API that is available for use outside the module that provides it.
* Anything written or read from disk

Code can be included in the proposal directory, but not committed to the code base.

Remove this section if not applicable.

### Configuration

Describe any new or modified configuration.

Remove this section if not applicable.

### Metrics

Are there new metrics? Are the computation of existing metrics changing? Are there expected observable metric impacts
that change how someone should relate to the metric?

Remove this section if not applicable.

### Performance

Describe any expected performance impacts. This section is mandatory for platform wiring changes.

Remove this section if not applicable.

## Test Plan

### Unit Tests

Describe critical test scenarios and any higher level functionality tests that can run at the unit test level.

Examples:

* Subtle edge cases that might be overlooked.
* Use of simulators or frameworks to test complex component interaction.

Remove this section if not applicable.

### Integration Tests

Describe any integration tests needed. Integration tests include migration, reconnect, restart, etc.

Remove this section if not applicable.

### Performance Tests

Describe any performance tests needed. Performance tests include high TPS, specific work loads that stress the system,
JMH benchmarks, or longevity tests.

Remove this section if not applicable.

## Implementation and Delivery Plan

How should the proposal be implemented? Is there a necessary order to implementation? What are the stages or phases
needed for the delivery of capabilities? What configuration flags will be used to manage deployment of capability?
