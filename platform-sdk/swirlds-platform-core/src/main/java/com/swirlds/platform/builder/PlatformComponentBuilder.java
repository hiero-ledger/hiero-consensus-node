/**
 * The advanced platform builder is responsible for constructing platform components. This class is exposed so that
 * individual components can be replaced with alternate implementations.
 * <p>
 * In order to be considered a "component", an object must meet the following criteria:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>A component must not require another component as a constructor argument.</li>
 *     <li>A component's constructor should only use things from the {@link PlatformBuildingBlocks} or things derived
 *     from things from the {@link PlatformBuildingBlocks}.</li>
 *     <li>A component must not communicate with other components except through the wiring framework
 *         (with a very small number of exceptions due to tech debt that has not yet been paid off).</li>
 *     <li>A component should have an interface and at default implementation.</li>
 *     <li>A component should use {@link ComponentWiring ComponentWiring} to define
 *         wiring API.</li>
 *     <li>The order in which components are constructed should not matter.</li>
 *     <li>A component must not be a static singleton or use static stateful variables in any way.</li>
 * </ul>
