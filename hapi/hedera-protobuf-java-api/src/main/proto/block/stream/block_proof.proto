/**
 * A cryptographic proof for the "Block Merkle Tree".
 *
 * This message SHALL offer a proof for the "Block Merkle Tree".
 * The information in the "Block Merkle Tree" SHALL be used to validate the
 * full content of the most recent block, and, with chained validation,
 * all prior blocks.
 *
 * ### Block Merkle Tree
 * The Block Hash of any block is a merkle root hash comprised of a binary
 * merkle tree, as described below.
 *
 * #### Computing the hash
 * The process for computing a block hash is somewhat complex, and involves
 * creating a "virtual" merkle tree to obtain the root merkle hash of
 * that virtual tree.<br/>
 * The merkle tree SHALL have the following structure:
 * - The merkle tree SHALL be structured as a binary tree.
 * - The merkle tree root SHALL have a "left-most" node containing the
 *   block's beginning timestamp.
 * - The merkle tree root SHALL have a "right-most" subtree comprised of 16
 *   leaves and associated internal nodes.
 * - The first four "levels" of the "right-most" subtree SHALL be internal
 *   nodes, comprising 15 in total.
 * - The fifth level of the "right-most" subtree SHALL be comprised of 16
 *   components (detailed below).<br/>
 * The "right-most" subtree's 16 components SHALL be, in order (from left
 * to right):
 * 1. A leaf containing the previous block's root hash.
 * 2. A sub-tree of "incrementally-collapsed" block hashes, ranging from
 *    the genesis block to the block immediately preceding the current
 *    block number, strictly ordered by block number.
 * 3. A leaf containing the hash of the state merkle tree at the start of
 *    the block.
 * 4. The root of a merkle tree composed of all consensus header items
 *    in the block. Leaf nodes in this subtree SHALL be ordered in the
 *    same order that the block items are encountered in the stream.
 * 5. The root of a merkle tree composed of all input items in the block.
 *    Input items SHALL be transactions, system transactions, and events.
 *    Leaf nodes in this subtree SHALL be ordered in the same order that
 *    the block items are encountered in the stream.
 * 6. The root of a merkle tree composed of all output items in the
 *    block. Output items SHALL be transaction result or transaction
 *    output items. Leaf nodes in this subtree SHALL be ordered in the
 *    same order that the block items are encountered in the stream.
 * 7. The root of a merkle tree composed of all state changes in the
 *    block. State change items SHALL be transaction result or
 *    transaction output items. Leaf nodes in this subtree SHALL be
 *    ordered in the same order that the block items are encountered
 *    in the stream.
 * 8. The root of a merkle tree composed of all trace data items in the
 *    block. Trace data items SHALL be transaction result or transaction
 *    output items. Leaf nodes in this subtree SHALL be ordered in the
 *    same order that the block items are encountered in the stream.
 * 9-16: Empty leaf nodes reserved for future use.<br/>
 * For the "right-most" subtree's internal nodes:
 * - Level four's internal nodes SHALL be the parents of the (ordered)
 *   16 leaves described above.
 * - Level three's internal nodes SHALL be the parents of level four's
 *   (ordered) internal nodes.
 * - Level two's internal nodes SHALL be the parents of level three's
 *   (ordered) internal nodes.
 * - Level one's internal node SHALL be the (single) parent of level two's
 *   (ordered) internal nodes.
 * The block hash SHALL be the hash calculated for the root of this merkle
 *   tree.
 * - The hash algorithm used SHALL be the algorithm specified in the
 *   corresponding block header.
 *
 * The term "incrementally collapsed" above is significant, and changes how
 * the tree hash is computed. Internal nodes are produced only when necessary
 * to add additional leaf nodes, and leaves may be at slightly different locations
 * in the tree if there are not enough nodes "to the right" to complete the full
 * tree. The specifics of this algorithm are published in detailed system
 * documentation.
