     * A TSS signature for one block.<br/>
     * This is a single signature representing the collection of partial
     * signatures from nodes holding strictly greater than 2/3 of the
     * current network "weight" in aggregate. The signature is produced by
     * cryptographic "aggregation" of the partial signatures to produce a
     * single signature that can be verified with the network public key,
     * but could not be produced by fewer nodes than required to meet the
     * threshold for network stake "weight".<br/>
     * This signature data is a complex aggregation of values needed to verify
     * the network signature, and may include WRAPS data to prove the chain of
     * trust for an address book as well as additional information relevant
     * to the current address book.
     * <p>
     * This message MUST make use of the "TSS" signature scheme and associated
     * "combined" signature data format, which provides the necessary
     * cryptographic guarantees and data elements.<br/>
     * This signature SHALL use a TSS signature to provide a single "signature"
     * that represents the consensus signature of consensus nodes.<br/>
     * The exact subset of nodes that signed SHALL neither be known nor
     * tracked, but it SHALL be cryptographically verifiable that the
     * threshold was met if the signature itself can be validated with
     * the network identity (A.K.A. ledger ID) and network WRAPS
     * verification key.
