# Repository Diátaxis Hub

`docs/diataxis/` mirrors the Diátaxis framework for non-AI documentation:

- `explanation/` – why the system works the way it does.
- `how-to-guides/` – goal-oriented recipes for humans.
- `reference/` – detailed descriptions of APIs, configs, or style guides.
- `tutorials/` – step-by-step lessons.

Populate these directories as you evolve repository-wide docs. AI-specific Diátaxis content now lives under `docs/ai/diataxis/`.
