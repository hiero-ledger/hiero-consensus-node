# AI Diátaxis Hub

AI-specific learning materials live here, organized per Diátaxis:

- `explanation/` – Concepts, philosophy, and rationale about the AI system.
- `how-to-guides/` – Goal-oriented recipes (e.g., managing task sequences).
- `reference/` – Detailed specs reused by humans (e.g., Gradle conventions).
- `tutorials/` – Step-by-step lessons facilitated by the `run tutorial` workflow.

When creating new human-facing docs for the AI system, place them under the appropriate subdirectory.
