# AI Directory Overview

`docs/ai/` groups all AI collaboration artifacts:

- `diataxis/` – Tutorials, how-tos, references, and explanations for humans.
- `system/` – Kernel guardrails, workflows, invocation table, and system metadata.
- `tasks/` – Persistent task sequences and other resumable AI work artifacts.

Use this README as the starting point when navigating the AI documentation tree.
