# Developer Project Notes

Use `docs/dev/` to capture human-authored project or issue notes that inform AI collaborations. Examples:

- Discovery conversations or meeting notes for a feature.
- Implementation plans authored outside of AI workflows.
- Architecture sketches or ADRs that the AI should reference.

Create subdirectories per project or issue (e.g., `docs/dev/hiero-stateproofs/`).
